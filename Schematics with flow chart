Here’s a conceptual design for your SUV prototype, combining speculative cold fission/fusion technology with hydrogen fuel, while aiming for Jaguar/Land Rover-like performance within a $110k budget. Note that cold fusion/fission remains unproven for practical applications, so this is a theoretical exercise based on cutting-edge research and automotive engineering principles.
